### Things to do:

* Make the form work!
* At the bare minimum, your form should console.log all the values for a new registration 
* If you feel that you have time, show registration values in a success message to the user (just as text)
* Extra bonus: Make a component for the success message and render it after the submit onclick()
* Extra bonus and kudos: If you have time, feel free to add more css to the new message or component
