Great work. Your code is clean and readable, and it works

### Things that I like about your code:
* You took the time to add css rules!!
* Your functions are precise. 

### Things that you need to consider:
* Great use of the input type color. But, if you're using an input color, you could use it. Try to find how to grab the value from an input type color using JS.
* Your functions don't check if the input of the user is incorrect. What happens with your buttons if I type "Monday". Start thinking about the user and the interaction with no valid inputs. 
* Maybe using CSS, the input colors should be more discrete. At this moment, without clear instructions, those are very distracting for the user. I honestly believe that they should do something for a couple of minutes, and I searched for the console error.
